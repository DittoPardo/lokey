LoKey: The Trickster Keyboard
=============================

This was a silly hackathon project written by
[Jonathan Zentgraf](https://github.com/zx96) and
[Joshua Stevenson](https://github.com/joshuastevenson).
It was mostly just a fun way to try out Android development.

LoKey is a keyboard that offers various settings to mess with you as you type,
all of which are configurable in its settings.  Right now, it has these
features:
  - *Swapping*:      LoKey will randomly swap the positions of keys on the
                     keyboard every time you press a key.
  - *Crazy Eights*:  Makes a reference to The Stanley Parable.
  - *Signature*:     Appends a string to a textbox when you press the done key.

We might add more features, or we might not, but either way, we had fun making
this, and maybe someone else out there will appreciate it.
