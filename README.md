LoKey: The Trickster Keyboard
=============================

This was a silly hackathon project written by Jonathan Zentgraf (@zx96) and Joshua Stevenson
(@joshuastevenson). It was mostly just a fun way to try out Android development.

LoKey is a keyboard that offers various settings to mess with you as you type, all of which are
configurable in its settings.  Right now, it has these features:
  - *Swapping*:      LoKey will randomly swap the positions of keys on the keyboard every time you
                     press a key.
  - *Crazy Eights*:  Makes a reference to The Stanley Parable.
  - *Signature*:     Appends a string to every textbox you press the done key in.

We might add more features, or we might not, but either way, we had fun making this, and maybe
someone else out there will appreciate it.
